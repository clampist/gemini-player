# Gemini Homepage Playwright Tests

This project contains a lightweight Playwright Test setup to validate that the Gemini homepage is reachable and can accept a basic search query without authentication.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or newer
- npm 9 or newer

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

## Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Useful Variants

- `npm run test:headed` &mdash; executes tests in a visible browser window.
- `npm run test:ui` &mdash; opens the Playwright test runner UI for debugging.
- `npm run test:report` &mdash; opens the latest HTML report generated by the last run.

## Project Layout

- `playwright.config.ts` &mdash; shared Playwright configuration with Gemini base URL.
- `tests/gemini-home.spec.ts` &mdash; smoke test covering homepage load and a simple search submission.

## Artifacts

- The latest HTML result report lives under `playwright-report/`; use `npm run test:report` to open it.
- Each successful run drops a screenshot in `artifacts/` (for example `artifacts/gemini-home-<timestamp>.png`) and attaches it to the HTML report.

## Continuous Integration

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/playwright.yml`) runs on pushes and pull requests targeting `main`. It installs Playwright browsers, executes `npm test`, and uploads two artifacts:

- `playwright-report` &mdash; download and open `index.html` locally to inspect the run.
- `screenshots` &mdash; raw PNG files captured during the suite.

Artifacts are retained for seven days; adjust `retention-days` inside the workflow if you need a longer window.

## Notes

- The search flow relies on common Gemini selectors. If the public site changes, update the locators in `tests/gemini-home.spec.ts`.
- Browser binaries are managed via `npx playwright install`. Re-run the command if you delete the Playwright cache.
